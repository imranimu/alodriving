                                        <p>The Parent-Taught Driver Education Program Guide (PTDE)  is a comprehensive guide provided by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) that you must request before starting any coursework. This guide contains all the necessary documents to complete the program, earn a learner's permit, and eventually, a provisional license.</p>

                                        <p>To request your official TDLR PTDE guide, you have two options: online or by mail. The guide costs $20, and it is not included in your online course purchase price. You can fill out the Texas Request for Parent Taught Driver Education Program Guide on the TDLR website and select to have the PTDE program guide emailed or mailed to yourself. If you choose to have it emailed, you can pay the $20 fee with a credit card and receive the guide sooner than if it were to be mailed. On the other hand, if you prefer to have the guide mailed to you, you may print and fill out the PTDE Instructor Designation Service Request form and mail it with a $20 check or money order payable to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation to the following address:</p>

                                        <p>Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation PO Box 12157 Austin, TX 78711-2157</p>

                                        <p>After you've paid for the PTDE guide, you can immediately download a PDF from the download link on the payment confirmation screen. If you selected the PTDE guide to be emailed, you will also receive an email with an additional link to download the packet. If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam or junk mail folders. However, if you opted to have the PTDE program guide mailed, you should allow up to 14 days for delivery by USPS after the Texas Department of Licensing and regulation has processed your request. </p>

                                        <p>To check the status of your Request for the Parent-Taught Driver Education Program Guide, you can visit https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/ParentTaught/PT_Search.aspx. Once you've received your PTDE education program guide and reviewed the course requirements, you can start with the online course material provided by the licensing department.</p>

                                        <p>Passing the driving test is an essential step in the process of getting a Texas driving license. What to anticipate during the exam is as follows:</p>


                                        <p>The exam is administered by a customer service representative (CSR) from the Department of Public Safety, who will assess your driving abilities.</p>

                                        <p>The CSR will check the car you're driving to make sure it has passed inspection and is legal.</p>

                                        <p>For the exam, you must bring your own car.</p>

                                        <p><b>What Will Determine Your Score:</b></p>

                                        <p>During the exam, four fundamental skills—control, observation, location, and signaling—will determine your score.</p>

                                        <p>Additionally, you'll be required to drive in reverse, stop swiftly, and complete other precise driving maneuvers.</p>

                                        <p>If you're operating a manual gearbox vehicle, you must utilize the clutch properly and respect all traffic signs and signals.</p>

                                        <p>Additionally, the CSR will anticipate that you will be able to navigate intersections with ease, make smooth lane changes while maintaining your position, maintain right-of-way, follow, pass, and maintain the proper lane, and maintain good posture by keeping your hands on the wheel and keeping your elbows off the window.</p>

                                        <p><b>The following will make you fail:</b></p>


                                        <p>If you break any laws, disobey any directions, drive recklessly, or have more than 30 points taken off your test, you will fail the exam.</p>

                                        <p>How to Prepare: To get more familiar with driving rules and regulations, think about taking a driving course or practicing with a licensed driver.</p>

                                        <p>Examine the Texas Driver's Handbook and practice exams online.</p>

                                        <p>Learn about the particular driving activities that will be assessed throughout the exam.</p>
